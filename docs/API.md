# Python contract - 0.1.x router-native baseline (stable request signatures)

Public import: `legends_dataforseo`. Package: `legends-dataforseo-kit`.
`API_ROOT = "https://api.dataforseo.com/v3"`.

```python
api_request(
    path, payload=None, *, method=None, body=None,
    credentials=None, timeout=90, log_cost=False, confirm=False,
    consumer="python", estimated_cost_usd=None, max_cost_usd=None,
) -> dict

serp(keyword, *, location_code=2840, language_code="en", depth=10,
     **request_options) -> dict
demand(keywords, *, location_code=2840, language_code="en",
       **request_options) -> dict
maps(keyword, *, location_coordinate, language_code="en", depth=100,
     **request_options) -> dict
```

`payload` is the existing positional task array. `body` is its keyword alias;
specify only one. `method` is GET or POST; if omitted, a payload selects POST,
otherwise GET. POST requires a nonempty list of task objects. A live SERP call
accepts exactly one task; a SERP queue POST accepts at most 100. Use raw
`api_request` for endpoint-specific fields not exposed by the named helpers.

`path` is relative to v3, optionally beginning `/v3/`. Absolute URLs, query
strings, encoded path traversal, and redirects are rejected. No alternate host
option exists. TLS verification remains enabled.
An optional terminal `.ai` suffix is accepted explicitly. It is never added
automatically. Provider AI responses can differ from standard task envelopes and
omit cost; see [response modes](WORKFLOWS.md#optional-provider-ai-responses).

`confirm=True` is a noninteractive paid/raw opt-in. It is mandatory for POST
and unclassified GET requests. Registered free GET and task retrieval GET need
no paid opt-in. A caller that already approved a scan passes confirm on its
paid request; the transport never adds another approval dialog.

`estimated_cost_usd` is the caller's reviewed estimate for the whole request.
When `max_cost_usd` is supplied, an estimate is required and must not exceed the
ceiling. Both must be finite, nonnegative numbers. This rejects requests before
credentials or HTTP; it is not a provider-side spending limit, reservation,
multi-request budget, or guaranteed price. The caller owns those policies.

## Responses and errors

Returns the complete JSON object when the top-level status is `20000`.
Per-task statuses are never converted into transport errors, even when
`tasks_error` is nonzero. This preserves `20100`, `40601`, `40602`, `40102`, and
other statuses so the caller can distinguish pending, empty, and failed tasks.

`ApiError` indicates an HTTP, network, decoding, or top-level envelope failure.
It has `.response` (decoded object or None) and `.http_status` (integer or None).
Exception messages do not echo provider text, query bodies, or credentials.
`request_may_have_completed` is true after an ambiguous POST transport/protocol
failure. Never treat a timeout as evidence that a paid submission was rejected.
Treat `.response` as private data. `CredentialError` means missing/incomplete
credentials; `RouteError` is invalid input; `CostLimitError(ApiError)` is a
preflight refusal. There are no automatic retries, account fallbacks, queue
polls, or sleeps. A timeout does not prove that the provider did not charge.

```python
from legends_dataforseo import ApiError, api_request

try:
    response = api_request("/serp/google/maps/task_get/advanced/" + task_id)
except ApiError as error:
    response = error.response  # Keep private; classify before another request.
```

## Credentials and local state

`Credentials(login, password, source="explicit")` hides login/password in repr.
Explicit credentials override the environment. Otherwise `load_credentials()`
uses DATAFORSEO_LOGIN or DATAFORSEO_USERNAME plus DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD. A partial
process pair fails rather than falling through to another account. Windows
user-scope fallback applies only when the process pair is entirely absent.

No account identity, legacy credentials, account-routing state, or credential
files are bundled. `credential_status()` returns presence/source only.
`log_cost=False` is the default. Opt-in cost logging uses
`LEGENDS_DATAFORSEO_LEDGER` or a user state directory (LOCALAPPDATA,
XDG_STATE_HOME, or ~/.local/state). It stores timestamp, endpoint template,
cost, top-level status, and caller-supplied consumer label. Use a non-sensitive
consumer label. Ledger errors warn without hiding the completed API response.

Offline helpers: `load_routes()`, `route_for(operation)`,
`estimate_cost(operation, *, tasks=1, depth=0, items=0)`, `total_cost(responses)`.
`write_json(Path, payload)` explicitly saves caller-selected data.

## Compatibility

The baseline ships optional helpers on top of the stable request signatures and
standard response format. Existing GeoGrid and GitHub callers need no changes.

```python
wait_task(path, *, max_attempts=5, interval=5, timeout=90, max_elapsed=300,
          credentials=None, consumer="python", log_cost=False) -> dict
response_summary(response) -> dict
response_view(response, *, summary=False, select=None, limit=None,
              output_file=None)
docs_index(section=None, **options) -> dict
docs_sections(**options) -> dict
docs_search(query, *, limit=20, section=None, **options) -> dict
docs_read(path, **options) -> dict
```

`wait_task` is a separate opt-in helper, never part of `api_request`. It performs
only supported saved-task GETs. Its report preserves the last original envelope
under `response`, with `state`, `stop_reason`, `attempts`, `elapsed_seconds`,
`reported_cost_usd`, `reported_cost_complete`, and `cost_scope`. Reported cost is
from the last response; retrieval may repeat the original submission cost and
must not be added as another charge. Only pending statuses
20100/40601/40602 cause another GET. Errors, unknown statuses, empty results,
attempt limits, and elapsed bounds stop it; transport exceptions propagate.
See [queue workflow and precise bounds](WORKFLOWS.md).

`response_view` returns a separate view and never mutates the input. Dotted
selection uses numeric indexes (for example `tasks.0.result.0.items`). Summary
task metadata remains complete even when displayed result lists are limited.
`output_file` labels an already saved file; the Python view helper does not write
it. A missing reported cost is flagged, not labelled free. Legacy `total_cost`
sums present costs and treats missing ones as zero; do not use it to claim a
complete bill when responses omit cost or repeat the same task's cost. The
optional cost ledger also records provider reports, not incremental charges.

Documentation options: `cache_dir=None`, `offline=False`, `refresh=False`,
`ttl=86400`, `timeout=20`. These helpers never load API credentials. Failures raise
`DocumentationError`. [Discovery and caching](DISCOVERY.md).

The 0.1.x router-native generation is the supported public baseline. It keeps
the positional `api_request(path, payload)` transport and timeout/consumer/confirm
keywords. Public defaults are single-account, all paid calls confirmed, logging
off, and task statuses caller-owned. Private account failover, workstation
installers, and PowerShell-specific wrappers are not part of the public API.
Pin a release or full commit. Breaking changes will be documented and versioned.

## Research evidence

`legends_dataforseo.evidence` provides offline `export`, `verify`, and
`assess_reuse` helpers. The module CLI supports `export` and `verify`.
See [research memory](RESEARCH-MEMORY.md) for the complete handoff contract.
No provider calls, implicit vault writes, or request API changes are introduced.
